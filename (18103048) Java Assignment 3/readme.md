Inside the webScraper folder, first of all we shall see 4 csv files.
  1) faculty.csv
  2) links.csv
  3) paragraph_text.csv
  4) pdf_links.csv
 
The links.csv and the paragraph_text.csv is generated by the general webCrawler, which recursively visits the web pages starting from the home page of PEC and goes till a depth of 10.

The faculty.csv is generated by the Focused Webcrawler which extracts information that is relevant with respect to the faculty.

Finally the pdf_links.csv contains the links of all the pdf documents which we obtained by crawling various web pages, starting from the pec home page.

The codes for the same are present inside the src folder.

Also the output can also be viewed in the form of screenshots present in the Screenshots folder.

There is also a downloads folder, which contains the psf documents that have been downloaded while crawling the websites for pdf documents
